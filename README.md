# SQL Music Store

## Project Overview

The SQL Music Store project is a database management system designed to handle the data for a music store. It includes tables for artists, albums, tracks, customers, and sales. This project demonstrates SQL queries for creating, managing, and querying the database, focusing on complex operations and data relationships.

## Features

- **Artist Management**: Store and manage artist information.
- **Album and Track Management**: Handle album and track details, including genre and duration.
- **Customer Data**: Manage customer information and purchase history.
- **Sales Tracking**: Track sales transactions and revenue generated.
- **Complex Queries**: Perform joins, subqueries, aggregations, and more.

## Database Schema

- **Tables**: `Artists`, `Albums`, `Tracks`, `Customers`, `Sales`.
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-Many: `Artists` to `Albums`
  - One-to-Many: `Albums` to `Tracks`
  - One-to-Many: `Customers` to `Sales`
  - Many-to-Many: `Tracks` to `Sales` (via a junction table)
